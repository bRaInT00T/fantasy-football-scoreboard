# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will hopefully be documented in this file.
Expect maximum jank until 0.1.0, minimum. We're talking WD-40 and duct tape code.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres as best as I can bother to try 
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
